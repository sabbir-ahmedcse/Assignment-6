#### 7) Create a README file to answer the following question-


#### 1) What is the difference between var, let, and const?
The primary differences between var, let, and const in JavaScript are scope, reassignment, and re-declaration. var is function-scoped and can be reassigned and re-declared. let is block-scoped, cannot be re-declared, but can be reassigned. const is block-scoped and cannot be reassigned or re-declared, though the contents of an object or array it references can be modified. 

#### 2) What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()? 
The JavaScript array methods map(), forEach(), and filter() serve distinct purposes when working with arrays.
#### 3) What are arrow functions in ES6?
rrow functions, introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6), are a concise alternative to traditional JavaScript function syntax, using the => operator for shorter, more readable code, especially for callbacks. Key features include a streamlined syntax with optional parentheses and curly braces for single-expression functions, and a unique way of handling the this keyword, which is lexically bound to the surrounding scope, unlike regular functions.  
#### 4) How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?
Destructuring assignment in ES6 is a powerful feature that allows for extracting values from arrays or properties from objects and assigning them to distinct variables in a concise and readable way. This simplifies code by reducing the need for repetitive assignments. 
#### 5) Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?
Template literals, introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015), offer a more flexible and readable way to create strings compared to traditional string concatenation.
